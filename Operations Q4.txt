 Q4-->
 Operators precedence determine how operators are parsed 
 to each other. Operators of high precedence becomees the 
 operands of lower precedence.
 console.log(1 + 2 * 3) // 1 + 6
 Output:-7
 console.log(4 + 5 * 6) // 4 + 30
 Output:-34

 and associativity determine in which the operators of same precedence 
 are parsed
